  <h2>About Agnes</h2>
  <p1>Agnes Wong is currently a student at John Bowne High School. She is
    currently a member of Senior Office and a former member of Chinese

    annual Chinese New Year's Assembly along with other members. She had
    volunteered at a daycare for the last two summers. Agnes is currently a
    volunteer librarian at Queensboro Hill Library. Agnes Wong would like thank
    her Psychology teacher from 11th Grade, Mr. Martin Levy. "Mr. Lecy is a great
    teacher and has inspired me so much to pursue Psychology in college. He is
    not the annoying high school teacher we usually have, Mr. Levy taught us a
    ton of things. He told us to be proud of ourselves, support each other and
    more importantly he believed in us." Agnes Wong plans to double major in
    Psychology and Computer Science in State University of New York, Binghamton.</p1>

  <header>Why do you intend to double major in both Psychology and Computer Science?</header>
  <header1>I have always been fascinated with the human mind and behaviors. In my Intro to
  Psychology class during junior year, I usually volunteered in the role playing
  so we could have a better understanding of people and put ourselves in another
  person's shoes. I was part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at
  AIG. I liked computers when I was a kid. I always wondered how they worked.
  After going to the program during the summer of 2017, I find myself in love
  with coding. I may not be a Python person, but I love HTML and CSS. I had no
  coding experiences and not taken any computer science class in my high school
  prior to Girls Who Code.</header1>
  <header>What is your favorite subject?</header>
  <header1>History. It is also the subject I do the best on.</header1>
  <header>You mentioned Girls Who Code, what is it?</header>
  <header1>Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization founded by Reshma Saujani
  which provides coding experiences to middle school and high school girls.
  After School Clubs are free and mostly available in your areas. Summer
  Immersion Program is a FREE 7 week summer program for rising juniors and
  seniors to learn about computer science. I personally think that it was so fun
  and I made friends, practiced public speech. Make sure to check out their website
  at https://girlswhocode.com/.</header1>
